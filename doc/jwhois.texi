@chapter Introduction

@sc{jwhois} is an Internet Whois client that queries hosts for information
according to RFC 954 - NICNAME/WHOIS. @sc{jwhois} is configured via a
configuration file that contains information about all known Whois servers.
Upon execution, the host to query is selected based on the information in
the configuration file.

The configuration file is highly customizable and makes heavy use of
regular expressions.

@node Invocation, RIPE Extensions, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invocation

@sc{jwhois} uses the following command-line options:
@table @samp

@item --version
Print the program version and licensing information.

@item --help
Print a usage message summarizing the command-line options.

@item -c FILE
@item --config=FILE
Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default
system global configuration file.

@item -h HOST
@item --host=HOST
Overrides any specifications in the configuration file and queries HOST
directly.

@item -p PORT
@item --port=PORT
Specifies a port number to use when querying a HOST

@item -f
@item --force-lookup
This option forces the client to look up an entry from the
source Whois server, even if a current copy is available in
the system cache.

@item -n
@item --no-redirect
This option disables the content redirect feature

@item -d
@item --disable-cache
This disables the cache functionality.

@item -v
@item --verbose
Enables verbose debugging output where available.

@end table

The query can optionally contain the character @samp{@@} followed by
a host name to direct the search to that host. This works exactly like
specifying the host with @samp{--host}.

@node RIPE Extensions, Site Configuration, Invocation, Top
@chapter RIPE Extensions

RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) has defined a number of options that can be
used against a RIPE-compatible whois server (ripe.net, apnic.net and
others).  Unfortunately, there is really no way of telling whether a
host we are connecting to is RIPE-compatible or not.  RIPE extensions
are therefore not directly incorporated into the @sc{jwhois} client.
A list of the options can be found in RIPE Document 157 which you can get
from the RIPE ftp server, @url{ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/}.

It is possible to use these options together with @sc{jwhois} by changing
the format of the query slightly. If you were to search for all entries in
the RIPE database which lists the admin-c, tech-c or zone-c as CO19-RIPE,
you could use the following command syntax:

@example
$ jwhois -h whois.ripe.net -- -i admin-c,tech-c,zone-c CO19-RIPE
@end example

@samp{--} is used to separate the RIPE options from the jwhois options.

@node Site Configuration, Cache Functionality, RIPE Extensions, Top
@chapter Site Configuration

@sc{jwhois} is configurable via its configuration file, normally
called @file{jwhois.conf}. This file is looked for in the sysconfdir
that was specified when compiling the program (default is
@file{/usr/local/etc/} on most systems).

If no configuration file can be found, @sc{jwhois} will default all queries
to @url{whois.internic.net}.

An example configuration file that includes most known Whois servers can be
found in the @code{example} subdirectory of the official distribution.

The configuration file is split into a number of blocks. Each block
can contain a number of different options which are explained in the
sections below. You can also get an overview of the syntax by looking
at the example configuration file included in the distribution.

@end menu

@node Global, Whois-servers, , Site Configuration
@chapter Global

The only available global options are related to the
cache features in jwhois @xref{Cache Functionality}.
By default, the location of the configuration file is
@file{/usr/local/var/jwhois.db}, but this can be changed
at compile time. The option @option{cachefile} also
changes the location.

The default expire time for all cached objects it
7 days (168 hours). this can be changed with the
@option{cacheexpire} option. The value is the number
of hours that objects is considered to be current.

Example:

@example
cachefile = "/var/lib/jwhois.db";
cacheexpire = 168;
@end example

@chapter Whois-servers

When making a query, @sc{jwhois} looks at the @option{whois-servers}
block to determine which host to send the query to. The option
@option{type} can be set to change between two different kinds of
matching; @option{cidr} or @option{regex}.

@option{regex} matches using standard regular expressions.
@option{cidr} matches using CIDR net blocks.

The value of all objects can take one of two forms. Either a
hostname or the special option @option{struct}. The later
asks @sc{jwhois} to look at another option block in the
configuration file.

When matching using CIDR net blocks, the key can take the
special value @option{default} which matches everything.

@example
whois-servers @{
        type = regex;
        ".*-[A-Z]+$" = "struct handles";
        ".*" = "whois.internic.net";
@};
handles @{
        type = regex;
        ".*-RIPE$" = "whois.ripe.net";
        default = "whois.arin.net";
@};
@end example

@node Content-redirect, , Whois-servers, Site Configuration
@chapter Content-redirect

@option{content-redirect} is a special block designed to
parse the output returned by a Whois server looking for
special regular expressions and then sending the same query
to the Whois server gotten from the regular expression.

The key value is the name of the Whois server that this
expression is applicable to. This is matched using regular
expressions. The value is the regexp that is looked for in
the output, with hostname and optional port number enclosed
in so called subexpressions or groups.

@example
content-redirect @{
        ".*" = ".*Whois Server: \\(.*\\)";
@};
@end example

@node Cache Functionality, Reporting bugs, Site Configuration, Top
@chapter Cache Functionality

@sc{jwhois} implements support for maintaining a cache of Whois data
received from Whois servers. This is NOT enabled by default but has
to be compiled into the client specifically. The design is such that
a central database is maintained by the client and because all users
should have access to that database, the program must have the
set-group-on-execution bit set and the database must be both read and
writable by the group.

The configuration options available are @sc{cachefile} and @sc{cacheexpire}
which sets the database filename and the expire time for cached object.
When an object expires from the cache, it is reloaded from the Whois server
the next time it is requested. The expire time is measured in hours.
